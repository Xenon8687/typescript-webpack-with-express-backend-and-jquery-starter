## Useful Scripts

`start`: Starts existing build. You should use build script before use this.

`build`: Builds project.

`prod`: Builds and starts project.

`dev`: Starts project with reloading. (Hot reloading isn't working on front end. I don't sure but I think it isn't working due to there is no UI framework like React.js.)

## Very Important Note

**You should use assets inside src/static dir due to using copy-webpack-plugin**
